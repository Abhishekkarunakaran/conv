# ub2: A `uuid-base64` converter tui.
---
### Why this project ?
While working on a project, I needed to convert a UUID to Base64.
I tried using an online converter, but it didn’t work the way I expected.

So, I wrote a quick Go script to handle it.

Then I thought — *“Why not turn this into a TUI app?”*
And well, I did just that!!
